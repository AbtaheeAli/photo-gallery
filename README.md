Created a front-end application of a photo gallery of items that describe who I am as an individual

This application consists of:

- Five components: App, CategoryList, PhotoList, PhotoDetail, & Header.

- On the home page, the category list renders the title of each category and link using the JSON file.

- The application renders each photo in the given category on the photo list page with a thumbnail-sized version of the photos.

- The application renders a large version of the photo on the photo details page.

- Added bread crumb navigation.

- Added a thumbnail to the first photo in each category to the home page.

- The application uses react router to navigate through pages.

- The application is dynamic using the data that is in the JSON file.
